## About

Following the recent events in America, Twitch decided to remove the original PogChamp emote due to the person behind the face inciting further violence. [Source](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347003152222937088).

To replace the iconic 'Pog' moment that the old PogChamp emote filled, based on a community suggestion, Twitch are now rolling out a new face for the PogChamp emote every 24hrs. [Source](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347589555197595650).

Inspired by this, I decided to create [pogchamp.today](https://pogchamp.today), based on the [visuals Twitch used](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347953496964931601) in [recent PogChamp reveals](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1348314946501808135), to allow anyone to quickly see the latest PogChamp emote online.
